A repository containing my solutions to the programming tasks assigned by SoftUni in the "JS Advanced" course with 100/100 results at the judge system. Each solution is stored in a separate file or folder (in the case of tests and DOM problems), named according to the corresponding subject's name and number.
### List of all solutions
